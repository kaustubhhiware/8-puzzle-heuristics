# 8-puzzle-heuristics

Code repository for Artificial Intelligence, CS60045.

Implementation of A* and IDA* search to solve the 
[8-puzzle problem](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/branch-bound-set-3-8-puzzle-problem/).
One of the  heuristics implemented is taking the approximation function ha(n) = 0 
which leads to a breadth first search.


Heuristics implemented:

* Euclidean distance

* Misplaced tiles

* Manhattan distance

* h = 0 (Breadth first search)

You can refer to [Documentation.pdf](Documentation.pdf) for some insights.
